# NLP-Homework_1
###Q1_REGREX.ipynb
- **Topic:** Regular Expressions   
- **What it covers:**
  - Matching patterns in text.
  - Extracting specific words, numbers, or symbols.
  - Validating formats like **emails, phone numbers, dates**.
  - Practical string manipulation with Python’s `re` module.  
  **Learning outcome:** Understand how to build and test regex for different text processing tasks.

### Q2_Programming_Question.ipynb
- **Topic:** Python-based programming exercises.  
- **What it covers:**
  - Problem statements with structured Python solutions.
  - Use of functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures.
  - Step-by-step explanation with outputs.  
Learning outcome:** Improve problem-solving skills and Python coding ability.

 ###Q3_Manual_BPE_on_a_toy_corpus.ipynb
- **Topic:** Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for NLP.  
- **What it covers:**
  - Explanation of BPE from scratch on a toy dataset.  
  - Step-by-step merging of frequent pairs.  
  - Vocabulary updates at each iteration.  
  - Final encoded vocabulary.  
- **Learning outcome:** Grasp how modern tokenizers (like GPT, BERT) compress vocabulary and represent words.

### Q4_WORD PAIR.pdf
- **Topic:** Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance).  
- **Problem Example:** Transforming **“Sunday” → “Saturday”**.  
- **What it covers:**
  - Two models with different costs for substitution, insertion, and deletion.  
  - Example sequence of operations:
    - Insert **a** → *Saunday*  
    - Insert **t** → *Satunday*  
    - Substitute **n → r** → *Saturday*  
  - Cost Calculation:  
    - Model A = **3**  
    - Model B = **4**  
  - Reflection on real-world applications:
    - Spell-check correction.  
    - DNA sequence alignment (where substitutions are biologically costlier).  
- **Learning outcome:** Understand how edit distance can be tuned for different applications
